# Assembler Project Read-Me

Welcome to the Assembler Project! This project is a C-based implementation of an assembler, developed based on instructions from a course in the Open University. The assembler is designed to convert assembly language programs into machine code that can be executed by a computer's processor.

## Overview

The assembler project consists of a C-based implementation of an assembler, which follows the guidelines and instructions provided by a course in the Open University. The project aims to translate assembly language instructions into machine code, enabling the execution of programs on a target architecture or processor.

The project is divided into the following components:

1. Lexical Analysis: The lexical analysis component is responsible for breaking down the assembly language program into individual tokens, such as instructions, labels, operands, and symbols.

2. Parsing: The parsing component analyzes the tokens generated by the lexical analysis phase and builds a hierarchical representation of the program's structure. It ensures that the assembly language program adheres to the syntax rules and identifies any potential errors.

3. Symbol Table: The symbol table module keeps track of the symbols used in the assembly language program, such as labels and variables, and their corresponding memory addresses.

4. Code Generation: The code generation component translates the parsed assembly language program into machine code instructions. It assigns memory addresses to labels and variables and generates the binary representation of the program.

## Contribution Guidelines

As the assembler project is based on instructions from a course in the Open University, contributions may not be applicable unless explicitly allowed by the course guidelines. It is recommended to follow the guidelines and instructions provided by the course and consult with the relevant teaching staff for any clarification or additional information.

## Resources

- The course materials provided by the Open University, including lectures, tutorials, and any accompanying documentation.

- Recommended textbooks or references suggested by the course for learning assembly language and implementing assemblers in C.

- Online forums or communities related to the course or assembly language programming, where we can seek guidance or discuss specific challenges.

- The Open University's support channels, such as online forums or direct communication with teaching staff, to clarify any questions or concerns.

## Conclusion

The assembler project based on instructions from a course in the Open University offers a valuable opportunity to learn and apply assembly language programming concepts and develop proficiency in building an assembler using the C language. By completing the project, we gained a deeper understanding of assembly language, parsing techniques, symbol management, and code generation.
